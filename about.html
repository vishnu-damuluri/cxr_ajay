                The recent advancements in hardware and computing power have led to new developments 
                in virtual and augmented reality, computer graphics and vision, and machine learning. 
                Imagine what would it be like living in 2030 and beyond, where the customer, who wants 
                to buy a land from a real-estate company will be able to experience the land and its 
                surroundings at the comfort of their home or experience the house that is about to be built. 
                It is estimated by 2022 the XR market is expected to grow $209 billion, which is eight times 
                what is today. This tremendous growth could mean the realities of our 2030 lives are 
                beyond our imagination’s ability to grasp. To explore this new technology and its 
                applications, the GITAM XR labs will offer hardware, support along with expertise, and 
                dedicated workspaces to further the technology growth through research and development.

      <p6  style="color:azure; font-size:medium;">
        GITAM envision to be an influential player in Academics along with Research and 
        Development. To produce effective leaders and effective workforce in a relevant field 
        GITAM proposed to create and develop 5 centers of excellence within the campus.
        <br>
        <br>
         XR Lab
        is one of them. We aim to make this XR lab a technological hub with the state-of-the-art 
        virtual and augmented reality devices, much-needed computers, motion and gesture 
        detection devices, haptics, 3D scanners etc. We intend to provide a space where researchers, 
        graduate and post graduate students, start-ups, and industries come together and address 
        the needs of XR. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The lab is intended to address the challenges of AR/VR which lies in several areas such as 
        medicine, gaming, training, sports, storytelling, education, and demonstrations. 
        This Extended Reality (ER) Lab is intended to put major emphasis on futuristic interaction 
        technologies including virtual, augmented and mixed reality. 
        The main focus is on promoting this ER Lab into a Center of Excellence by developing a 
        community of empowered students and faculty in the area of Augmented, Virtual and 
        mixed reality, through multiple collaborations with both well established Industry and 
        Academic AR/VR centers. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This lab will engage in AR/VR curriculum development along with teaching, research, 
        and services for developing advanced methods and algorithms for near-real 3D user 
        interfaces and exploratory data analysis in virtual environments. 
        Emphasis will also be laid on application-driven, interdisciplinary research by 
        extending the collaborations in future with all the reputed institutions worldwide, and 
        partners from industry, covering fields like medicine, defence, simulation science, 
        production technology, product development, neuroscience and architecture.
        <br>
        <br>
        We aim at providing a platform for students to work on this futuristic technology and also 
        encourage them to join one of the available projects with our research and industry partners 
        either through their curriculum or as a resident graduate student.
        Through XR lab, we aim to offer hardware and expert support for the researchers. This XR 
        lab also plays a role in bringing the researchers and students into contact for collaborative 
        work on some interesting projects.

              Extended Reality (XR) is an emerging area that includes all the immersive technologies 
              like Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed reality (MR) as 
              representative form plus those that are yet to be created. These immersive technologies will 
              extend the reality that we experience by blending the virtual and real worlds or by creating 
              a fully separate immersive experience. According to the recent qualitative research, more 
              than 60% of the respondents believed that XR will be the mainstream in the next five years.
